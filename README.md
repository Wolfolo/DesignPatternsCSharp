# DesignPatternsCSharp

This is an exercise to better understand the design patterns usage by testing.
It's not intended as a library to be used for actual development.

The work is inspired by the Wikipedia article about design patterns which can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern
